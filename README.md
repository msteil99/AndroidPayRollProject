# AndroidPayRollProject
Android project for tracking individual payrolls

This is a project I am creating to learn android studio. The idea of the project is to track my payroll. I wanted to practice navigating through
an android application with fragments in a MVVM structure. The Main acitvity handles navigating through and openeing fragments. This payroll project
is demostrating storing and retrieving values set by the user.
